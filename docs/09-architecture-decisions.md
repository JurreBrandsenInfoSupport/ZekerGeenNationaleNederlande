# 9. Architecture Decisions

## 9.1 NextJS Framework

**Decision**: Use NextJS as the primary framework.

**Rationale**:
- Provides server-side rendering for better performance and SEO
- Integrated routing simplifies navigation implementation
- Rich ecosystem of tools and libraries
- Strong developer community support

**Consequences**:
- Integration with React ecosystem is seamless
- Improved initial page load performance
- Simplified deployment through Vercel or similar platforms
- Development team needs to understand React and NextJS concepts

## 9.2 Component-Based UI

**Decision**: Implement a component-based UI architecture.

**Rationale**:
- Promotes reusability and consistency
- Easier maintenance and updates
- Better separation of concerns
- Facilitates collaborative development

**Consequences**:
- More structured codebase
- Reduced duplication of UI elements
- Consistent look and feel across the application
- Easier to implement design system changes

## 9.3 In-Memory Data Storage

**Decision**: Use in-memory JavaScript arrays for data storage in the prototype.

**Rationale**:
- Simplifies development for prototype/demonstration purposes
- Removes database setup requirements
- Allows quick iteration and testing

**Consequences**:
- Data is not persistent across server restarts
- Not suitable for production use
- Will need to be replaced with a real database for production

## 9.4 API Documentation

**Decision**: Use Swagger/OpenAPI for API documentation.

**Rationale**:
- Standardized format for API documentation
- Interactive testing capabilities
- Facilitates communication between development teams
- Enables automatic client code generation

**Consequences**:
- Clear documentation for API consumers
- Reduced integration issues
- Easier onboarding for new developers
- Better maintenance of API endpoints
