# 11. Technical Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Data Persistence | All data is lost on server restart | Implement proper database integration for production |
| No Authentication | Unauthorized access to all system features | Implement authentication and authorization for production |
| Browser Compatibility | Some users may experience UI issues in unsupported browsers | Regular testing across major browsers; graceful degradation |
| API Performance | Slow API responses could affect user experience | Implement caching strategies; optimize database queries; monitor performance |
| Scalability | Growth in users or data volume could impact performance | Design for horizontal scaling; implement performance monitoring |

## 11.1 Risk Assessment Matrix

| Risk | Probability | Severity | Priority |
|------|------------|----------|----------|
| Data Persistence | High | Very High | Critical |
| No Authentication | High | Very High | Critical |
| Browser Compatibility | Medium | Low | Medium |
| API Performance | Medium | High | High |
| Scalability | Medium | Medium | Medium |

## 11.2 Monitoring and Mitigation Strategy

- Implement proper database integration before moving to production
- Add authentication system before exposing to real users
- Implement performance monitoring for critical system components
- Establish load testing procedures for new releases
- Create a browser compatibility testing matrix and schedule
